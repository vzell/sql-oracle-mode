Future Development of SQL Oracle Mode
*************************************

   The following sections describe future development of SQL Oracle Mode.
Besides mid-term goals, bug reports and requests we cannot fix or honor
right away are being gathered here.  If you have some time for Emacs
Lisp hacking, you are encouraged to try to provide a solution to one of
the following problems.  If you don't know Lisp, you may help us to
improve the documentation.  It might be a good idea to discuss proposed
changes on the mailing list of AUCTeX first.

This is a wishlist of features to add in future releases, in no
particular order:

1 Mid-term Goals
****************

   * Integration of preview-latex into AUCTeX

     As of AUCTeX 11.81 preview-latex is a part of AUCTeX in the sense
     that the installation routines were merged and preview-latex is
     being packaged with AUCTeX.


2 Wishlist
**********

   * Documentation (man/info/HTML ??)


3 Bugs
******

   * The parsed files and style hooks for `example.dtx', `example.sty',
     `example.drv' and `example.bib' all clash.  Bad.
